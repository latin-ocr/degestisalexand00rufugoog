Tar present work of Q. Curtius Rufus has come down to us in·-
aomplete-the first two books, and some portione in the middle
and near the end, being wanting in all the manuscripts. Itwonld
seem that the ancient copyist, who considered the first two books,
containing the life and exploits of Alexander mainly aller Iris
entering Asia, to be less necessary or interesting, commenced
transcribing at the third book, when Alexander having gained
the victory on the Granicus, had already obtained a firm footing
in Asia, and was entering upon his successful career, conquering
countries which had never before been the scene of Greek mili·
tary enterprise. The other gaps in the work have been filled up
in modern editions, as in the present, by the supplements of the
learned Freinsheim3 so that the history of Alexander is con·
tinued uninterruptedly down to the point to which Curtius in·
tended to carry it-namely, to the establishment of a regency
‘aller the death of the conqueror. The fact that the same gaps
occur in all manuscripts, justifies the inference, that the manu·
scripte known to exist, and the number of which is eighteen‚
are derived from one and the same, which has thus become tha
mother-codex for all the others. The copies, however, present
great differences in detail; for towards the end of the middle
ages, the textos Curtius was subjected to a thorough revision by
a scholar who was very clevet, but at the same time ollen too
bold, and frorn' this revised copy others again were made, partly
with new emendations, and partly with unintentional mistakes.
In this manner we may distinguish three classes of manuscripts
-namely, 1. Ancient and faithful copies, without intentional cor·
sections, but sometimes unintelligible, because the original manu·
script itself wa's in some parts faulty or illegiblo; 2. Manuscripts
which betray the correcting hand of the above-mentioned scholar,
but are otherwise written with tolerable accuracy3 3. Manuscripta
which are based upon the revised copy, but are disfigured by
numerous mistakes, arising partly from arbitrary emendations,
and partly from carelessness
