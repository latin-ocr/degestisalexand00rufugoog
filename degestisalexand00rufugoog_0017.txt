1110 01000 01 the fifieenth century (the first is that 01 Venice
1471), 010 based upon manuscripts 01 the third class, because
they were 01 more recent origin, and consequently more legible.
The faults which were thus introduced throughout the text,
though they consisted only in single words and their arrange·
ment, have rcmained unerpunged until the most recent times,
although the defects did not escape the notice 01 learned edi·
turs, and many parts of the textwere corrected, sometimes
by conjectures, but more frequently from better manuscripts,
by the scholare of the sixtecnth century, as by Franciscus
Asulanns (in the edition of Aldus, 1525), Hadrianus Junius
(1546), and Franciscns Modius (1579). Their emendations, bow·
ever, met with little confidence, because the reasons and sources
01 their corrections were but rarely and incompletely stated.
Hence other editors, and among them especially Freinsheim
(1640 and 1610), who has otherwise great merite, preferred re·
taining the old and faulty text, and altering it only in such pas·
seges where it seemed indispensably necessary. Owing to a
feeling 01 reverence 101 freinsheim, the text as constituted by
him remained unchanged in the large edition of Snakenburg
(Dellt and Lsydeu, 1724); and on the whole, in all the subse·
quent editions also, although the faulty nature 01 the vulgate ³
became more and 111010 obvious by comparing several ancient
and good manuscripts. Schmieder (Gdttingen, 1803) was the
first who restored. a much mors correct text, though he did 1101
001 consistently throughout, 1111 explanatory notes in Latin also
deservo praise on 0000011101 his diligence and shund judgment.
The present editor first published an edition 01 Curtius (Berlin,
1826), in which, with the assistance 01 more manuscripts than
any 01 1110 predecessore had made use of, he restored the text,
00 101 as possible, 01 1110 genuine and urradulterated manuscripts
01 1110 flrst class. In the commentary 10 1110 great edition (Brane-
wien, 1849), he has stated the reasons and sources 01 011 the
changes 110 has made in the text, giving at the same time a com·
⁴plete 00001101 01 1110 different readings 01 both the manuscripts
and the early editions. Tlre critical reader is thereby enabled
10 recognise the condition 01 the 10111, and, it is hoped, to con·
vince himself 01 the correctness of the course which the editor
hasadopted.

The text here presented is the same as that 01 the last-men·
tioned edition, to which, 101 all critical questions, the reader
is referred. The notes accompanying the present edition do

1101 enter into critical discussions, their object being the expla· ·

natica 01 the text; and combined with the ample contente pre·
flxed to each book, they fumish everything which appeared ·
necessary to lead a studione youth to ,a correct understanding
