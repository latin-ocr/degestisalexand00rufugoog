Tu work ‘De Gestis Alexandri Magni, regis Maoedonum,’ is
ascribed in the manuscripts to an author of the name of
acarnanum. The first two books are lost, and the work,
as it has come down to us, begins with the third. This acci·
dent has deprived us of the preface, which the author had una
questionably prefixed to his work, and in which he probably
also gava some account of himself and his circumstances. ln
addition to this, it so happens that no other ancient author
makes mention of this Latin work on the life of Alexander-
a circumstance which occurs also in the case of the ‘Astro-
nomica’ of the poet Manilius, and the ‘Historia Romana’ of
Velleius Paterculus. We cannot, therefore, say with any cer·
tainty who this Q. Curtius Rufus, mentioned on the title-page,
really was, or at what time the book was written. In the work
itself, however, wo find some allusione ιο the time at which the
author wrote: two passageswhich may admit of an extended
period—namely, iv. 20, where it is stated that Tyre, after its fall
under Alexander, was in the enjoyment of peaceful tranquillity,
under the protection of Roman clemency, by which everything
was rsfreshing and renovating itself during the blessings of a long
peace, and iv. 45, where the author, inspeaking of the Parthians,
says, that they, having, immigraterl from Scythia, now occupied
the country which at the time of the Persian monarchy was ini
habited by the Parthyaei. From this passage, however, we can
only infer that the work was written previous ιο the year a. n.
2263 for in that year the Parthian power in Asia was destroyed
by the rising of the new Persian Empire. Little, indeed, can be
guthered from these allusione concerning the period at which
this history os Curtius was written, but there is a third passage
(x. 28) which throws more light upon the question, sor there the
author explains how, after the death of Alexander, when so many
