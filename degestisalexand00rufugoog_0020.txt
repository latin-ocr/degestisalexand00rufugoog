new star to give light again to tlre darkened universe, when tbe
discordant members os the whole were in restless commotion
without a leader. He extinguished the firebrand of civil war3
he sheathed the swords, and dispersed the storin by sudden
light’ The author closes this eulogy on the princeps with the
hope that if envy can but be kept away, the descendants os
the same house will last sor ever, or at least for a very long
period. We believe that this princeps, to whom the Roman Em·
pire was indebted sor a much happier fate than the Macedonian
Empire experienced, was no other than Augustus, who put an end
to the disturbances and civil wars which arose iu consequence os
the sudden death os Caesam and who, through the unity of his
government, gave new strength arrd prosperity to the Empire.
We oi course understand the passage figuratively, when the
author speaks os the night which enveloped the universe, and the
rising of a new star; but we believe he was led to make use oi
this figurative expression hythe extraordinary phenomenon, that
during the whole os the year in which Cesar was murdered,
the sun appeared to have lost his splendour, and a dreary mist
hung over the country-a phenomenon which is attested by eon·
temporary authors. We are especially induced to entertain the
’ opinion, that Augustus must be understood by the simple expres·
sion, ‘that the Roman people owed thet happiness to their
princepa' because this designation was new in the case of Augus·
tus, and was made use ol by him with especial predileetion,
whereas it became necessary tc employ much stronger expres
siens os veneration with the subseqnent emperors. Messenen
the simple appellation free from all flattery, ‘the descendants ot ·
the same house,’ alludes to a succession consisting oi several
younger members os the family, as Augustus ‘actually possessed,
particularly in his two eldest grandchildren, Gaius and Lucius
Ceasar. We therefore come to the conclusion that Curtius wrote
his history of Alexander some years before the Christian era,
but at the latest in the year ol the birth os our Saviou13 sor the
two above-named adopted sons os the princeps died in the years
2 and 4 alter Christ, whereupon the stepson os Augustus, Tiberius
Claudius Nero, was appointed his successor: the latter was theu
in the mature age of manhood, and is he had been mentioned, be
would have been indicated in a more significant manner.

We meet with two persons in Roman authors who bear- the
name Curtius Rufus: first, the rhetorician Q„ Curtius Rufus, in the
index to the work os Suetonius, ‘De claris Rhetoribus.' This worlr
treats, in an introductory chapter, os the lives of the most eminent
teachers of Latin eloquence, and asterwards each separate rheto-
rician is treated ol in a separate chapter. Ol this worlt, however,
we have only the beginning. 'l’he introduction and the hves oi
