tlte five most ancient rhetoricians are all that have corne down to
us: the continuation, which, according to the index, should con·
tain the lives of elenen rhetoricians, particularly No. 6, that of
L. caestius Pius, No. 7, that of M. Porcius Latro, No. 8, that of
Q. Curtius Rufus, &c- iro, is lost, and no other notice of this
rhetorician existe. Α second person of this nante is the con·
salar Curtius Rufus mentioned in Pliny, Epist. vii. 27, and espe-
cially in Tacitus, Anu. xi. 20. It is related of him that he rose
from the humblest staden, through the support os his patrona and
his own energetic eloquence, to the dignity of a senator; aud
Tiberius himself (who reigned from the year uu. 14 to 37) pro·
moted him to the praetorship, and afterwards even made him
consul (namely, suffectus); and in the year ω). 47 he received
the iusignia triumphalia as commender of the Roman army on
the Upper Rhine3 and at last was made proconsul of Africa·-
tha highest honour a Roman statesman could attain under the
emperors3 in which office he died at an advancsd age, probably
in the year nu. 52. Itis unknown whether these two men
named Curtius Rufus were related or not: we might have known
had Tacitus, in the above-mentioned passage, expressed him·
sslf with less reserva respecting tha origin of the consular, as
he says the common opinion that he was the son of a gladia·

tor was wrong, but that he himself was ashamed to state the ‘

truth. The question now is, whether either of thern was the
author of the life of Alexander· It has been even asserted by
some that they were one and the same person, and that the
rhetorician Q Curtius Rufus, aster spending a life devoted to
literature, engaged in the service of the state5 but we cannot
possibly admit this, as the transition from the one to the other
is so rara an occurrence, lhat Tacitus and Pliny, who give a tole·
rably detailed account of the consulat, would necessarily have
mentioned this ciroumatance. We, moreover, have little doubt
that if a Roman consular had written such a work, either in the
earlier years of his literary life, or in the leisura of a more ad·
vanced age, frequent mention would have been rnade os it by
contemporary authors. We therefore believe that the first-rnen·
uonad Q. Curtius Rufus is the author of the following work: and
if we have proved above that the Roman princeps, who is praised
in the work as the preserver of the Roman Empire, is Augustus,
and that Curtius wrote at a tima when the house of Augustus
still contained some promising young men, we may add that
the best period of the rhetorician coincides with tha tirno of the
firmly-established sovereignty of Augustus; that is, about the
year of the birth of Christ Μ. Porcius Latro is the imme-
diate predecessor of Curtius in the list of rhetoricians, whose
liras Suetonius wrote, and he died, according to Hieronymus in
