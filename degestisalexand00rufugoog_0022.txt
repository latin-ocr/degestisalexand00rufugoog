his ‘chronicon‘ olymp. tet, 13 that is, abacti or‘3 s. c.; so that
we are justified in connecting the best period of our author with
the year in which his predecessor in the list died. It is possible,
indeed, thet the consular, whose real origin Tacitus conceals from
a feeling of modesty, was an illegitimate son of the rhetoricien.
These scholare who suppose the authores the life of Alexander
to be either the rhetorician mentioned by Suetonius, or the con·
sular described by Tacitus -as well as those who consider the
eulogy on the Roman princeps, x. 28, to refer to Augustus, or
Claudius, or Vespasien, or even, which is still less possible, to
Trajan-agree with us in the opinion that the Latin language in
the worlr of Curtius is worthy of all praise. We ourselves
’ recognise in it the perfection of Roman literature, on account cf
the perfect accuracy in the appropriate use of separate words,
and in the syntecticel combination ol' words into clauses end
sentences. There is only one point in which a slight deviation
from the classical prose of Cicero and Caesat may be observed3
nemely, that sometimes the expressions which were formerly
used only in poetry are here introduced into prose-such as
mcum for vita or cetae, juventa for juventus, saevas for eadelm,
⁸ immanis ,· the frequentanti thereby weakened use of ingens, and
of linqsoere for relinquen also the joining passive verbs with
the dative instead of using the preposition ab. The frequent use
of ceterum for scd, in which, however, Sallust had preceded Cur·
tius, is lilrewise a slight deviation from the earlier language.
Other deviatione, such as the absolute use of the participle per·
fect passive- for, instance, audito fot qaum auditum esest, with a
sentence following, the use of the participle future active in con·
nection with a hypothetical sentence-for instance, viii. 11, aci·
nucem sirium percussum merent, cisi prohibitus essct, should be
considered rather as examples of a judicious development of
the language than as defecta, since brevity and precision of ex·
pression ere thereby promoted. The speeches‚ in particular,
which Curtius, agreeably to the custom of the ancients and the
example of other historiens, interweeves into his history, are
distinguished for their energetio eloquenoe, and for the appropri-
ateness in the characters of the speakers3 from which circum·
stance we may infer the rhetorical activity cf the author, and
his intention to produce awork with specimene of his slrill. He
had in this respect, and indeed in the whole composition of
his history, a model in the Greek work of Clitarchus, a cele·
brated historiari, who lived soon after the death of Alexander,
and was much praised by the ancients for his rhetorical powers,
though he was suspected of credulity, especially in his descrip-
tion of the wondsrs of far distant countries. The same defecta,
accordingly, are found in our Latin author, hut it musana
