orders this disaster to be concealed from the army. (33) He
shows himself to the soldiers in hia armour, and thereby excites
their spirits, so that they eagerly prepare to crosa the Jaxartes.
Ambassadors corne from the Scythiam to the camp, and deliver
an oration (34, 35), in which they reproach th'e king for excas-
sive ambition‚ and admonish him not to entertain the foolish
idea, that the good fortune which has hitherto attended him will
¹ favour him if he attacks the free Scythiam. (36) Alexander,
notwithstanding the opposition of the Scythians, succeeds in
crossing the Jaxartes in a manner previously arranged. (37) He
defeats the enemy, and gives orders to pursue thern so long as
the day permits. (38) This victory, and an instance of Alexan-
der's clemency which follows it, induce the Scythians to apply
for terma of peace. Alexander hastens to Maracanda, forces
Spitamenes to flee, and causes the army which follows him to
punish the rebels. (39) This part of Sogdiana was the fruitfirl
district on the river Polytimetus. Thirty leading Sogdianians
are condemned to death, but are pardoned, and show by their
subsequent faithful conduct that they have merited the royal
favour. (40) Peucolaus is left behind with a troop, to guard tha
province. Alexander takes up hia winterouarters (winter of
aaa-328 ac.) in Bactra, and obtains supplements of troops. He
then breaks up aud marehes to Margania, subdues the disuiet,
and builds six cities. (41) Arimazes, who has taken possession
of an impregnable rock, still stands out against Alexander.
Three hundred chosen soldiers are called for by the king to
climb to the summit (42), which they accomplish. (43) Terrified
by the sight of these, and by a rnovement of the army as if for
an assault, Arimazes surrenders, but, on account of his pride and
aelf-confidence, is put to death.
